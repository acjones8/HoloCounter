Holo Counter
============

Warning: Here be dragons. And copious amounts of spaghetti code. Seriously, this repo is not for the faint of heart.

Screenshots

These are currently the only two screens of the app. Should there be more, they will be added here. If there's one kind of documentation I never skimp out on, it's screenshots.

Features
--------

* Press anywhere on the screen to count up. This is the main feature of the app.
* Press a small area on the bottom of the screen to count down. Nothing silly like opening an entirely new menu just to count down.
* Set a custom step to count with. You can count down or up with basically any (whole) number you can think of.
* Set a title for your count. Right now it's just a cosmetic feature, but it might evolve into a saving feature at some point.

Notes
-----

I've been working on this for a week now, and I think it's somewhat finished enough for it to go on GitHub. It'll be at least another month until I consider putting it up on the Play Store. If I do  release it in compiled form, it'll probably be on F-Droid or something first.

I'm a relative beginner, so I honestly couldn't be arsed with compatibility libraries for platforms older than 4.0 (well, technically 3.0/API 11, but you don't want to run this on a tablet :P).

I was mostly inspired by the very nice Tally app for iOS, and was rather surprised at how ugly all the other counter apps for Android were. I wanted to change that, so here we are.
